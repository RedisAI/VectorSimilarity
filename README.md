# VectorSimilarity

This repo exposes C API for using vector similarity search.
Allows Creating indices of vectors and searching for top K similar to some vector in two methods: brute force, and by using hnsw algorithm (probabilistic).

The API header files are `vec_sim.h` and `query_results.h`, which are located in `src/VecSim`.

## Algorithms

All of the algorithms in this library is designed to work inside RediSearch and supports the following features:
1. In place insert, delete, update of vectors in the index.
2. KNN queries - results can be ordered by score or ID.
3. Iterator interface for consecutive KNN queries.
4. Range queries
5. Multiple vector indexing for the same label (multi value indexing)
6. 3rd party allocators

#### Datatypes SIMD support

| Operation | x86_64 | arm64v8 | Apple silicone |
|-----------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| FP32 Internal product |SSE, AVX, AVX512 | No SIMD support | No SIMD support |
| FP32 L2 distance |SSE, AVX, AVX512| No SIMD support | No SIMD support |
| FP64 Internal product |SSE, AVX, AVX512, AVX512DQ | No SIMD support | No SIMD support |
| FP64 L2 distance |SSE, AVX, AVX512 | No SIMD support | No SIMD support |

### Flat (Brute Force)

Brute force comparison of the query vector `q` with the stored vectors. Vectors are stored in vector blocks, which are contiguous memory block, with configurable size.


### HNSW
Modified implementation of [hnswlib](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib). Modified to accommodate the above feature set.

## Build
For building you will need:
1. Python 3 as `python` (either by creating virtual environment or setting your system python to point to the right python distribution)
2. gcc >= 10
3. cmake version >= 3.10

To build the main library, unit tests and python byndings in one command run
```
make
```

## Unit tests
To execute unit tests run

```
make unit_test
```
## Memory check

To run unit with valgrind run
```
make unit_test VALGRIND=1
```

## Python bindings

Examples for using the python bindings to run vector similarity search can be found in `tests/flow`.
To build the python wheel, first create a dedicated virtualenv using python 3.7 and higher. Then, activate the environment, install the dependencies and build the package. Please note, due to the way poetry generates a setup.py, you may have to erase it prior to re-running *poetry build*.

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install poetry
poetry install
poetry build
```

To run in debug mode, replace the last two lines with:

```
DEBUG=1 poetry install
DEBUG=1 poetry build
```

After building the wheel, if you want to use the package you built, you will need to manually execute a *pip install dist/<package>.whl*. Remember to replace <package> with the complete package name.

### Testing python bindings
This will create a new tox environment, install the wheel and execute the python bindings tests
```
tox -e flowenv
```

# Benchmark
