# VectorSimilarity
Starting with version 8.0, RediSearch and this vector similarity library is an integral part of Redis. See https://github.com/redis/redis

This repo exposes a C API for using vector similarity search.
Allows creating indices of vectors and searching for top K similar to some vector in two methods: brute force, and by using the hnsw algorithm (probabilistic).

The API header files are `vec_sim.h` and `query_results.h`, which are located in `src/VecSim`.

## Algorithms

All of the algorithms in this library are designed to work inside RediSearch and support the following features:
1. In place insert, delete, and update vectors in the index.
2. KNN queries - results can be ordered by score or ID.
3. Iterator interface for consecutive KNN queries.
4. Range queries
5. Multiple vector indexing for the same label (multi-value indexing)
6. 3rd party allocators

### Flat (Brute Force)

Brute force comparison of the query vector `q` with the stored vectors. Vectors are stored in vector blocks, which are contiguous memory blocks with a configurable size.


### HNSW
Modified implementation of [hnswlib](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib). Modified to accommodate the above feature set.

## Metrics
We support three popular distance metrics to measure the degree of similarity between two vectors:

| Distance metric | Description                                                    | Value range      |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| L2              | Euclidean distance between two vectors.                        | [0, +âˆž)          |
| IP              | Inner product distance (vectors are assumed to be normalized). | [0, 2]           |
| COSINE          | Cosine distance of two vectors.                                | [0, 2]           |

The above metrics calculate distance between two vectors, where smaller values indicate that the vectors are closer in the vector space.

## Build
For building you will need:
1. Python 3 as `python` (either by creating a virtual environment or setting your system python to point to the right python distribution)
2. gcc >= 10
3. cmake version >= 3.10. (To build the `python bindings` you will need cmake < 3.26 due to `pybind11` policy version handling).

To build the main library and unit tests in one command run

```
make
```

## Unit tests
To execute unit tests run

```
make unit_test
```

## Memory check

To run the unit tests with Valgrind run
```
make unit_test VALGRIND=1
```

## Python bindings

Examples of using the Python bindings to run vector similarity search can be found in `tests/flow`.
To build the Python wheel, first create a dedicated virtualenv using Python 3.7 and higher. Then, activate the environment, install the dependencies, and build the package. Please note, due to the way poetry generates a setup.py, you may have to erase it before re-running *poetry build*.

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install poetry
poetry install
poetry build
```

To run in debug mode, replace the last two lines with:

```
DEBUG=1 poetry install
DEBUG=1 poetry build
```

After building the wheel, if you want to use the package you built, you will need to manually execute a *pip install dist/<package>.whl*. Remember to replace <package> with the complete package name.

### Testing Python bindings
This will create a new virtual environment (if needed), install the wheel, and execute the Python bindings tests
```
poetry run pytest tests/flow
```
Or you can use the make command:
```
make flow_test
```
