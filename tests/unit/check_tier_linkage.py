"""Guard the SIMD tier objects against sharing externally visible symbols.

Every file under spaces/functions/ is compiled for one instruction-set tier, each with its
own -march/-m flags, and the running CPU's feature bits decide which tier's Choose_* entry
point is called. The kernels themselves are templates at namespace scope, so if two tiers
instantiate the same template they emit the same mangled symbol holding bodies built for
different architectures. The linker then keeps whichever object it saw first and nothing in
the source decides which. That either silently downgrades the faster tier or, once a body
contains an instruction the weaker tier's CPU lacks, faults in the query path.

Tiers stay distinct by naming: a kernel reachable from two tiers must carry the tier in its
name, as NEON_HP/NEON_FHM and SVE/SVE2 do. This test checks that invariant on the built
archive, so a new tier or a newly shared kernel header cannot reintroduce the collision
unnoticed.

Usage: check_tier_linkage.py <path to libVectorSimilaritySpaces.a>
